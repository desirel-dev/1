The Calculating Space Theory: A Guide to the Concept, Implications, and Applications in Universe Simulation
 Thomas Alexander Syrel
 1. Foundations of the Theory
 The Calculating Space Theory (CST) postulates that space is an active processor, where interactions between 
elementary particles constitute computational operations.
 Key elements:
 ● Space as a Computational Medium:
 Space is not passive but dynamically processes information through the interactions of particles (e.g., collisions,
 energy exchanges).
 ● Particle Density and Time:
 High particle density slows down the "processing" of space, manifesting as time dilation, which is interpreted as 
gravity.
 ● Emergent Gravity:
 Gravity is not a fundamental force but arises from the local slowdown of space’s computations.
 ● Curvature of Spacetime:
 Spacetime curvature is a consequence, not the cause, of gravity—a reversal of the perspective provided by 
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (GTR).
 Comparison with Other Theories:
 ● Digital Physics/“It from Bit” (Wheeler):
 CST goes further by linking particle density with the rate of computation and gravity.
 ● Bostrom’s Simulation Hypothesis:
 CST proposes a specific mechanism of “simulation” based on spatial processing rather than on abstract code.
 2. Theoretical Implications
 a) Redefinition of Time and Gravity
 ● The passage of time depends on the local "bandwidth" of space. In the vicinity of complex objects (with higher 
particle density), computations slow down, explaining time dilation.
 ● Gravity is an illusion resulting from differences in the rate of information processing between regions of space.
 b) Unification of GTR and Quantum Mechanics
 ● Common Foundation:
 Both theories might emerge from the computational nature of space. For example, quantum uncertainty could 
correspond to computational limitations (such as discrete processing steps).
 ● The Problem of Non-locality:
 CST might struggle to explain quantum entanglement.
 c) The Speed of Light Constant
 ● In General Relativity (GTR), the speed of light (c) is constant in a vacuum. In Calculating Space Theory (CST),  
The speed of light is constant because photons move horizontally through an inter-matrix space rather than 
progressing through time, and thus they are not subject to the “processing” performed by the matrix.
 3. Universe Simulation According to CST
 a) Hypercomputer Architecture
 ● Requirements:
 The simulation would require a system that processes information in a massively parallel way—possibly using 
spin networks or quantum technology.
 ● Processing Matrix:
Space would be represented as a “processing matrix,” where its “depth” corresponds to time delays, and energy
 corresponds to the cost of state transitions in the network.
 b) Algorithms Generating Physics
 ● Particle Modeling:
 Algorithms would need to recreate fundamental interactions (e.g., electromagnetism) through computational 
rules (for instance, cellular automata).
 ● Emergence of Physical Laws:
 Physical constants (such as Planck’s constant) could emerge from the parameters of the matrix (e.g., its 
processing frequency).
